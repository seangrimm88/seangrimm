					<p>In my role as a physical therapy aide, I leveraged my background in Kinesiology to enhance patient well-being. 
					As a direct assistant to licensed physical therapists, I played a pivotal role in ensuring the delivery of high-quality care in a timely manner. 
					My meticulous attention to detail allowed me to assist in advancing patients' exercise regimens, collaborating closely with therapists to optimize care plans. 
					provide regular progress updates and promptly communicate any concerns to the therapist for swift resolution.
					</p>
					<p>
					From a young age, I cultivated a passion for fitness, initially pursuing a path towards becoming a physical therapist. 
					However, I have since transitioned into a data-driven healthcare career, where I aspire to make a positive impact. 
					With deep respect for healthcare providers, stemming from my two years as an assistant to licensed physical therapists,
					I am committed to utilizing my skillset to streamline and enhance the delivery of care.
